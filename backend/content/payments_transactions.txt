Payments and Transactions

How to Add a Bank Account
To add a bank account, go to 'Settings' > 'Payment Methods' and click 'Add Bank Account'. You'll need your bank's routing number and your account number. We'll verify the account by making two small deposits (usually under $1) that you'll need to confirm. This process takes 1-2 business days.

Transfer Limits and Fees
Standard transfers are free and typically process within 1-3 business days. Instant transfers have a small fee (usually $0.50-$1.00) and are available immediately. Daily transfer limits are $5,000 for new accounts and can be increased to $25,000 after account verification. Higher limits may be available for premium accounts.

International Money Transfers
We support international transfers to over 50 countries. Fees vary by destination and amount, typically ranging from $5-$25. Exchange rates are updated in real-time. Transfers usually take 1-5 business days depending on the destination country and banking system.

Transaction History and Statements
You can view your transaction history in the 'Activity' section of your account. Download statements in PDF format for any date range. Statements include all transactions, fees, and account activity. You can also export data in CSV format for personal record-keeping.

Payment Methods
We accept various payment methods including bank transfers, debit cards, and digital wallets. Each method has different processing times and fees. You can set up automatic payments for recurring bills and manage your payment preferences in your account settings.

Transaction Disputes
If you notice an unauthorized transaction or need to dispute a charge, contact our support team immediately. We'll investigate the issue and work with you to resolve it. You're protected by our zero-liability policy for unauthorized transactions.
