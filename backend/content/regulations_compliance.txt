Regulations and Compliance

Know Your Customer (KYC) Requirements
KYC regulations require us to verify your identity and understand your financial activities. This includes collecting personal information, verifying your identity with government-issued documents, and monitoring your account for unusual activity. These requirements help prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Policies
We're required to monitor transactions for suspicious activity that might indicate money laundering. This includes reporting large cash transactions, unusual patterns, or transactions involving high-risk countries. We may request additional information about certain transactions to comply with AML regulations.

Data Privacy and GDPR Compliance
We protect your personal data in accordance with GDPR and other privacy regulations. You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information. We only collect data necessary for our services and never sell your information to third parties. You can manage your privacy settings in your account preferences.

Tax Reporting Requirements
We provide necessary tax documents including 1099 forms for interest earned and transaction summaries. These documents are available in your account by January 31st each year. Keep records of all transactions for your tax preparation. Consult a tax professional for specific tax advice.
